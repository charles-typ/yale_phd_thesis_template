First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Anurag Khandelwal, for his unwavering guidance and support throughout this journey. I was fortunate to meet Anurag during an exchange program at UC Berkeley, and even more fortunate to collaborate with him throughout my PhD. Anurag has been my most accessible mentor during graduate school, offering support on both research challenges and personal matters. His insightful feedback has not only shaped my research skills but also helped me grow into a better researcher.

I am deeply thankful to my dissertation committee members: Lin Zhong, Abhishek Bhattacharjee, and Hong Zhang. Their feedback and encouragement have played a crucial role in shaping this dissertation. Although Lin and Abhishek were not my official advisors, they have consistently provided valuable advice on my research and presentations. Hong guided me through my first few projects in graduate school, and his meticulous approach to research has had a lasting influence on me.

I extend my heartfelt appreciation to my exceptional group of collaborators, including Seung-seob Lee, Yanpeng Yu, Grace Jia, Yash Lala, Jachym Putta, and Mahdi Soleimani. I feel truly fortunate to have worked with such a brilliant and inspiring group. Seung-seob has been like a second advisor to me, always available day or night to help me navigate challenges—his expertise seems boundless. I would also like to express my gratitude to the members of Lin's group and Abhishek's group, particularly Ramla Ijaz, Namitha Liyanage, Caihua Li, Guojun Chen, Yue Wu, Raghav Pothukuchi, Michael Wu, Nick Lindsay, Muhammed Ugur, and Karthik Sriram. Your camaraderie, collaboration, and support have greatly enriched my research journey.

I am also grateful to Ping Zhou, Tongping Liu, and Fei Liu from ByteDance for their invaluable support. I had the privilege of spending two incredible summers interning in the Bay Area, working on impactful projects with one of the best infrastructure research labs in the industry, and their guidance made those experiences truly rewarding.

To my amazing friends and colleagues at Yale—my "gang"—thank you for being my foundation over the past five years. This includes (in alphabetical order): Aosong Feng, Billy Yang, Daojing Zhai, Hao Dong, Hassaan Hashmi, In Gim, Jialu Zhang, Kaylee Yang, Ke Wang, Kean Xiong, Siqi Li, Tong Gou, Xi Li, Yuyang Liu, Zhiyao Ma, and Ziming Mao. I couldn’t have achieved anything without your constant support. Life at Yale would have been far less fulfilling without the time we spent together. I would also like to thank my undergraduate friends, Jiong Yang, for always meeting me in the summers and spending time together, and Cong Ding, for always being available for calls to discuss life and the future.

I am eternally grateful to my family. To my mother, Yanrong, and my father, Yazhe—you have been my greatest influences. My father, in particular, has been a role model, guiding me both academically and personally. Your unwavering belief in me has shaped the person I am today. I would also like to thank my younger brother, Yufeng, who has taken care of our family since I moved to the U.S. four years ago. His constant encouragement has always inspired me to push further.

Finally, to Ziyan Bao, the most important person in my life—thank you for standing by my side, for being my constant source of strength and support. I am deeply grateful for your unwavering love and encouragement.
