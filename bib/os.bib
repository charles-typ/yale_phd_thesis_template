abstract = {Hardware disaggregation has emerged as one of the most fundamental shifts in how we build computer systems over the past decades. While disaggregation has been successful for several types of resources (storage, power, and others), memory disaggregation has yet to happen. We make the case that the time for memory disaggregation has arrived. We look at past successful disaggregation stories and learn that their success depended on two requirements: addressing a burning issue and being technically feasible. We examine memory disaggregation through this lens and find that both requirements are finally met. Once available, memory disaggregation will require software support to be used effectively. We discuss some of the challenges of designing an operating system that can utilize disaggregated memory for itself and its applications.},

abstract = {Much like on-premises systems, the natural choice for running database analytics workloads in the cloud is to provision a cluster of nodes to run a database instance. However, analytics workloads are often bursty or low volume, leaving clusters idle much of the time, meaning customers pay for compute resources even when underutilized. The ability of cloud function services, such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, to run small, fine granularity tasks make them appear to be a natural choice for query processing in such settings. But implementing an analytics system on cloud functions comes with its own set of challenges. These include managing hundreds of tiny stateless resource-constrained workers, handling stragglers, and shuffling data through opaque cloud services. In this paper we present Starling, a query execution engine built on cloud function services that employs a number of techniques to mitigate these challenges, providing interactive query latency at a lower total cost than provisioned systems with low-to-moderate utilization. In particular, on a 1TB TPC-H dataset in cloud storage, Starling is less expensive than the best provisioned systems for workloads when queries arrive 1 minute apart or more. Starling also has lower latency than competing systems reading from cloud object stores and can scale to larger datasets.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) workflows are extremely complex. The typical workflow consists of distinct stages of user interaction, such as preprocessing, training, and tuning, that are repeatedly executed by users but have heterogeneous computational requirements. This complexity makes it challenging for ML users to correctly provision and manage resources and, in practice, constitutes a significant burden that frequently causes over-provisioning and impairs user productivity. Serverless computing is a compelling model to address the resource management problem, in general, but there are numerous challenges to adopt it for existing ML frameworks due to significant restrictions on local resources.This work proposes Cirrus---an ML framework that automates the end-to-end management of datacenter resources for ML workflows by efficiently taking advantage of serverless infrastructures. Cirrus combines the simplicity of the serverless interface and the scalability of the serverless infrastructure (AWS Lambdas and S3) to minimize user effort. We show a design specialized for both serverless computation and iterative ML training is needed for robust and efficient ML training on serverless infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that Cirrus outperforms frameworks specialized along a single dimension: Cirrus is 100x faster than a general purpose serverless system [36] and 3.75x faster than specialized ML frameworks for traditional infrastructures [49].},

In this study, we explore the application performance of ASIC CXL memory in various data-center scenarios. We then further explore multiple potential impacts (e.g., throughput, latency, and cost reduction) of employing CXL memory via carefully designed policies and strategies. Our empirical results show the high potential of CXL memory, reveal multiple intriguing observations of CXL memory and contribute to the wide adoption of CXL memory in real-world deployment environments. Based on our benchmarks, we also develop an Abstract Cost Model that can estimate the cost benefit from using CXL memory.},
