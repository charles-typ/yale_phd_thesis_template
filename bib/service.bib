abstract = {We show how a layered Cloud service model of software (SaaS), platform (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS) leverages multiple independent Clouds by creating a federation among the providers. The layered architecture leads naturally to a design in which inter-Cloud federation takes place at each service layer, mediated by a broker specific to the concerns of the parties at that layer. Federation increases consumer value for and facilitates providing IT services as a commodity. This business model for the Cloud is consistent with broker mediated supply and service delivery chains in other commodity sectors such as finance and manufacturing. Concreteness is added to the federated Cloud model by considering how it works in delivering the Weather Research and Forecasting service (WRF) as SaaS using PaaS and IaaS support. WRF is used to illustrate the concepts of delegation and federation, the translation of service requirements between service layers, and inter-Cloud broker functions needed to achieve federation.},

abstract="The operating system's role is often neglected in the availability analysis of modern, service-oriented applications. The usual argumentation is that the underlying OS seems to be irrelevant in the world of today's web-centric applications. We propose a framework for construction of ``service-oriented operating system'' and examine the role it plays in physical and user-perceived service availability by investigating potential abstractions and integration points between service-oriented applications and OS architecture, such as treating OS as a set of collaborating services, introducing standard middleware services as parts of an OS and including support for server consolidation through virtualization. We demonstrate how to address the following dependability attributes at the OS level: service availability (readiness for correct service), service reliability (continuity of correct service), integrity (absence of improper system alterations) and maintainability (ability to undergo modifications and repair). We further argue that availability at the OS level plays the key role in the availability of service-oriented applications and propose an orthogonal OS design methodology suited for that purpose.",
