\begin{abstract}
The increasing demand for scalable and efficient data center architectures has led to the adoption of resource disaggregation, which separates compute, memory, and storage resources across various interconnects. This paradigm shift from traditional monolithic server architectures allows for more flexible resource allocation and utilization. Memory disaggregation, in particular, addresses the bottleneck issues of traditional setups by decoupling memory resources, presenting them as pooled resources accessible on demand. This approach enhances efficiency, scalability, and adaptability, especially for memory-intensive workloads.

However, transitioning existing applications to a disaggregated architecture presents significant challenges due to the mismatch between current cloud stacks designed for monolithic systems and the requirements of disaggregated systems. These challenges span across different layers of the stack, including application interfaces, OS support, performance overheads, and the limitations of existing interconnect technologies. This dissertation focuses on addressing these challenges, particularly in the context of memory management within disaggregated architectures.

Our approach involves a comprehensive examination of the requirements for successful disaggregation, proposing strategies to mitigate performance penalties and enhance resource management. By adopting a top-down perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between service layers and core hardware elements, ultimately facilitating the transition to disaggregated data center architectures.
